# Bloxybrowser Backend
The proxy server for BloxyBrowser, the first ever browser in Roblox.

## How This Works:
This proxy will download the assets of the desired website, send them in JSON form over to the game via the Roblox API, convert it then to images, frames, and other Roblox components to make it viewable in the game.
